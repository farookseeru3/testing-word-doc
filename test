My Story of Studying In China

Khushboo Mushtaq,
Capital Medical University


Studying abroad was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I chose China, because China is one of the early civilizations with a rich history and culture, and because it is fast growing to becoming an economic powerhouse in the world. I believe that China is a land of opportunity and I thought studying abroad would give me the chance to learn more about the country. 
I landed in china in the year 2014 for MBBS. The Capital Medical University has been so far so good. Great learning, professional engagements and experiences, and above all perfect environment for budding doctors. The teachers here are very experienced and helping us in our MBBS journey. 

During my last several years in China, I learned so much about the country, the culture and the language. At first, I was nervous to embark on this journey, but I realized that I couldn’t just live my whole life within my comfort zone.
My time in China will be an unforgettable experience. Every day is a new adventure. I made life-long friends, and lasting memories. My study abroad program coordinated trips for us to learn about each cities culture, to visit cultural sights and to visit companies as well. While I was in Beijing, I climbed the Great Wall of China, visited the Temple of Heaven, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, and the Bird’s Nest Olympic stadium. I also had the opportunity of being stuck in a Beijing thunderstorm, bargaining in the marketplace, riding the high-speed train, and visiting the famous downtown food street. I am taking Chinese language and culture courses. What I enjoyed most about my studies in China, is that whatever Mandarin I learned in class, I would use outside as well to communicate with people, whether it be taxi drivers or shop keepers. Having the opportunity to speak Mandarin everyday really fostered my learning. In the afternoons I would have culture classes where I would learn about Chinese calligraphy, Beijing opera, Chinese martial arts, and Chinese cooking among many more subjects. The mix of learning about language and culture made each day of class enjoyable and exciting.
I believe that the key to a successful study abroad is the attitude you carry. Going to China, I had a very positive attitude. I was open minded, and flexible. I knew that of course things would be different, but I learnt to embrace these differences. I also knew that problems or conflict may arise, but I saw these as opportunities for learning. Having grown up in India, and having attended national level schools, I had already been exposed to a wide variety of culture. This has made me more culturally aware and more appreciative of diversity, which added to my positive attitude.
My time in China made me more self-aware, and made me assess my career goals. I am also now able to connect with Chinese students on a deeper level. I am more involved with the international students of the university, and volunteer to help students learn English. My time in China made me realize how passionate I am about diversity, and my interest in learning about other cultures.
